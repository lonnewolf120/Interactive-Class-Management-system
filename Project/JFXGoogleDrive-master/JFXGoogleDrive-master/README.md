The project uses the Google Drive API, in order to uset it you'll need to add your own _credentials.json_ file. You can create one 
for a QuickStart in Google's API Introduction Page [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/java).

The project currently supports the following operations:

- Shows the files currently hosted in your Google Drive Account
- Upload and Download Files

The user must give the app consent to do such operations.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize the process when uploading a file. (Checking the MIME type)
- Give functionality to the Quick Access panel.

## Inspiration
The design is based on @k33ptoo [original design](https://sellfy.com/p/2FwR/).
