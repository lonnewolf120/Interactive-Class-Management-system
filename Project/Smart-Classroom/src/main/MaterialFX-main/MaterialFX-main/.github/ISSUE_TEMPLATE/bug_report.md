**DISCLAIMER**
- Please, before reporting a bug make sure you have read the javadocs. If, by reading the issue, I realize you skipped this step it is very likely I will close the issue without even answering, marking it as 'invalid'! MaterialFX documentation is gold, make use of it!
- Some people seem to not realize that MaterialFX has a demo, basically a workbech for MaterialFX controls, and that it is a very valuable resource since there are a LOT of examples on how to use them.
If your issue is about "not knowing how to do this and that" please before asking check the demo maybe the answer is already there.
- Often the issues are about controls customization. Please before reporting the issue make sure to check the CSS files (both in [materialfx](https://github.com/palexdev/MaterialFX/tree/main/materialfx/src/main/resources/io/github/palexdev/materialfx/css) and [demo](https://github.com/palexdev/MaterialFX/tree/main/demo/src/main/resources/io/github/palexdev/materialfx/demo/css) modules) as the answer may already be there.
**Now that you have read the disclaimer you can remove it and proceed with the issue report**

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**[MRE](https://bit.ly/3k5gTJf)(Minimal Reproducible Example)**
- This is almost mandatory, if I can't reproduce the issue then it doesn't exist

- If possible the MRE should make use of Gradle(preferred) or Maven to quickly setup the project
